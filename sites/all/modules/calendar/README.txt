Creates calendar displays of Views results.

Create a new calendar by using the calendar template for the desired
date field. See a link to create a view from a template at the top
of the Views listing page.

If the Calendar iCal module is enabled, an iCal feed can be
attached to the view.

For a quick and easy start, install the Date Tools module, then use
the Date Tools Wizard to create a content type with a date field
and a calendar that displays that field, all in a single step!
